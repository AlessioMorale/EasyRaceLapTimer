# EasyRaceLapTimer modes in detail

## standard mode aka practice / time trial mode

The most used mode. Fly your laps, the system tracks your time. You can check later on who was the fastest in the practice / event etc.

## competition mode

The mode used for racing events. The system sums up the time for each lap of a pilot. The one with the fastest summary time is the winner. If used with satellites, you can define time penalties if a satellite doesn't get passed.

In competition mode, you must set manually the pilots who are attending the race. You can define new transponder tokens especially for this mode or simple keep the old ones.

If you enable the hot seat feature in the competition mode, you don't need to add pilots. If a pilot passes the sensor, he will get added automaticly to the current race.
